This is how your project directory should look:

kafka-wine-project/
├── docker-compose.yml
├── producer/
│   ├── Dockerfile
│   ├── producer.py
│   └── data/
│       ├── restaurant_data.csv
│       └── supplier_data.csv
└── consumer/
    ├── Dockerfile
    └── consumer.py
|
|__ results/
    |--feasibility_auctions.csv
