#IGNORE COMPLETELY FOR NOW
1. Have docker desktop setup on your pc. Then open docker desktop.
2. In VScode go to the project directory where docker-compose.yml is saved and run:
            docker-compose up --build
3. While its running wait 10 seconds
4. Open cmd then run:
            docker ps
5. After that run this to create a wine_demand topic that wine suppliers will ingest (also in the cmd):
            docker exec -it kafka-wine-project-kafka-1 /bin/bash -c "kafka-topics.sh --create --topic wine_demand --bootstrap-server localhost:9092 --partitions 1 --replication-factor 1"
6. Then in vscode split a terminal. One one side naviagte to the consumer folder and run:
            python consumer.py
7. Then On the other side of the split terminal navigate to the producer folder and run:
            python producer.py
8. You should see your producer sending data to kafka wine_demand topic which is then being consumed by the consumer on the other side
